Homework 1
==========

0. Install the Python distribution [Anconda](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) (choose Python 3.5).
   * Follow the lecture [Setting up Your Python Environment](http://quant-econ.net/py/getting_started.html).

0. Install [Julia](http://julialang.org/downloads/).
   * Follow the lecture [Setting up Your Julia Environment](http://quant-econ.net/jl/getting_started.html).

0. Create your own user account at [GitHub](https://github.com).
   * Press the "Watch" button at the top right on this page,
     so that I can recognize your username.
   * As an exercise, try to create a new repository at GitHub.
   * To manage your repositories, you are advised to install a GUI client
     (or you may use the command line version).
     I would recommend [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com).
     (Ask Google how to use it.)
   * You may refer to [this exercise](http://lectures.quantecon.org/py/getting_started.html#exercise-2).
