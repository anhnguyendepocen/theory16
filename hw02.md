Homework 2
==========

* Write your own code for the support enumeration algorithm in Python or Julia (or both),
  and run it for several example games on a Jupyter notebook
  (see [this](http://lectures.quantecon.org/py/getting_started.html#jupyter) for Python
  or [this](http://lectures.quantecon.org/jl/getting_started.html#jupyter) for Julia).

* Create a repository on GitHub, and push your Jupyter notebook to it.
  Create (or edit) a "README.md" file in your repository,
  and in that file, make a [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org) link to your notebook.
